# How to Add Your Photo

## Quick Steps:

1. **Prepare your photo:**
   - Make sure your photo is in JPG format
   - Recommended size: 800x800 pixels (square aspect ratio works best)
   - Good quality, well-lit portrait photo

2. **Replace the placeholder:**
   - Navigate to the `public` folder in your project
   - Replace the empty `photo.jpg` file with your actual photo
   - Make sure to keep the filename as `photo.jpg`

3. **Alternative filename:**
   - If you want to use a different filename, update the image path in:
   - File: `src/app/page.tsx`
   - Line: `src="/photo.jpg"` (change to your preferred filename)

## Photo Guidelines:

- **Format:** JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size:** 500KB - 2MB (optimized for web)
- **Dimensions:** Square (1:1 aspect ratio) works best
- **Quality:** High resolution, professional appearance
- **Background:** Clean, minimal background preferred
